# weeveNetwork
It is an indisputable fact that data has tremendous value when tokenized and used in a network to support the mechanics and principles of an economy. The Weeve network empowers the economy of things by introducing a commercialisation layer between (IoT) devices and the Blockchain. In the **weeveNetwork**, machines (or *Weeves* thereof) index, process, tokenize and trade harvested data against digital data assets, among them are most notably cryptocoins. 

Weeve envisions public or private marketplaces for any form of digital assets ranging from geo-data to electricity or delivery status, where data producers and consumers (resp., buyers and sellers) come together, escrow their supply and demand, and exchange their digital assets for agreed upon prices.

## Smart Contracts
The current smart contracts in this repository are a development state, they are not final at all. Our development goal is the implementation of the weeveNetwork and its components, namely the registries and marketplaces. We will update this repository regularly in the process of our development
